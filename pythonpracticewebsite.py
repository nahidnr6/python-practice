#6: String Lists : Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
# string = input("Input a string to see if it is a palindrome: ")
# reverse = string[::-1]
# print(reverse)

#7: Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
# a = [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]

# evens = [x for x in a if x % 2 == 0]

# print(evens)

#8: Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

#Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

#10: List Overlap Comprehensions
import random
 
# a = random.sample(range(1,30), 12)

#11: Check Primality: Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.
# import sys
# number = input("Please enter a number" + "\n" + ">>>")
# number = int(number)
# prime = False # initiate boolean for true false, default false 
# if number > 0: 
#     for x in range(2, number - 1): #this range excludes number and 1, both of which the number is divisible by
#         if number % x != 0: 
#             continue

#             sys.exit("The number is not prime")
#     sys.exit("The number is prime.")
# elif number == 0: 
#     sys.exit("The number is not prime.")
# else: 
#     sys.exit("The number is not prime")

#12 List Ends: Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

# def list_ends(list):
#     return [list[0], list[len(list)-1]]

# print(list_ends([4,8,3,9,1]))

#14 List Remove Duplicates - Write a program(function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates

# def duplicate(x):
#     y= []
#     for i in x: 
#         if i not in y: 
#             y.append(i)
#     return y

# print(duplicate([1,2,3,1,2,4,6,7,8,9]))

#15 Reverse Word Order - Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order.
# def reverse_v1(x):
#   y = x.split()
#   result = []
#   for word in y:
#     result.insert(0,word)
#   return " ".join(result)
